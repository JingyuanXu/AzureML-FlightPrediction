# How to Build & Visualize Machine Learning Predictions with Microsoft Azure & MicroStrategy
                            
Haven’t you always wondered where machine learning could actually be used by you? 
Imagine a powerful cloud-based machine learning application that’s created by a simple drag-n-drop interface along with powerful self-service analytics to provide useful insights.
What about using publicly available flight information to learn how to make a prediction using machine learning if a flight is likely to be delayed?
 
And then get this to work in about an hour?
 
Microsoft and MicroStrategy provide a step-by-step workshop to show how easy it is to create and use your own Azure ML Model with MicroStrategy Desktop to visualize your prediction as part of a hands-on workshop at MicroStrategy World in Washington, DC from April 18-20.
The three main tools used are Microsoft R Open, Azure Machine Learning and MicroStrategy Desktop.

# Microsoft R Open

Microsoft R Open, formerly known as Revolution R Open (RRO), is the enhanced distribution of R from Microsoft Corporation. It is a complete open source platform for statistical analysis and data science.    The current version, Microsoft R Open 3.3.2, is based on (and 100% compatible with) R-3.3.2, the most widely used statistics software in the world, and is therefore fully compatible with all packages, scripts, and applications that work with that version of R. It includes additional capabilities for improved performance, reproducibility, as well as support for Windows and Linux-based platforms. 
Like R, Microsoft R Open is open source and free to download, use, and share.  It is available from https://mran.microsoft.com/open/ .

# Azure Machine Learning

Data can hold secrets, especially if you have lots of it. With lots of data about something, you can examine that data in intelligent ways to find patterns. And those patterns, which are typically too complex for you to detect yourself, can tell you how to solve a problem. 
This is exactly what machine learning does: It examines large amounts of data looking for patterns, then generates code that lets you recognize those patterns in new data. Your applications can use this generated code to make better predictions. In other words, machine learning can help you create smarter applications.  Azure Machine Learning enables you to build powerful, cloud-based machine learning applications.

# MicroStrategy Desktop

MicroStrategy Desktop provides powerful self-service analytics that work seamlessly with Microsoft R Open and Azure Machine Learning to uncover insights. People  answer their toughest questions with MicroStrategy.
A small R script is provided to demonstrate how to connect to MicroStrategy Desktop and make an insightful dashboard to visualize your prediction.
 
Come join us at MicroStrategy World or try the workshop out for yourself.
