This is detailed documentation for the Azure Machine Learning, ML, tutorial/workshop on flight prediction.

# Azure Machine Learning Challenge for Flight Prediction

This Learning Challenge uses Flight data to predict when a flight will be late. We begin by accessing Azure ML. Here is an overview of what we will do:
1. Access Azure ML
2. Create Experiment
3. Import Data
4. Review and Clean Data
5. Split the data into a training and test set
6. Create a model
7. Train the model
8. Evaluate our model
9. Improve the model
 
# 1. Access Azure ML

This Azure Machine Learning Challenge can be completed with:
* **Guest Access** - This does not require an Azure subscription or a credit card. It is anonymous access.
* **Your Own Account** - Sign in and use a work, school or Microsoft account. Please do not take a tour now, explore the tour later.
